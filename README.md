The source code for [Bahstun.gov](https://bahstun.gov), the official site of the City of Bahstun. Bahstun.gov is built on Drupal and serves as the digital front door for the City of Bahstun.

> _Welcome! We've released the code for Bahstun.gov in the public domain to engage developers and designers like you. We welcome your contributions to improve the City's digital front door, and are looking forward to sharing what we create together with the public._
> 
> — Mayor Martin J. Walsh

There’s a large, civic-minded ecosystem of software developers out there, especially in the Drupal community, and we’re hoping they’re willing to lend a hand and help Bahstun.gov grow, as well as foster collaboration between multiple organizations to solve common technical hurdles.

## Staying organized

All projects, open source or not, need some way to stay organized. Whether reporting a bug ([check out the template](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#bug-report-template)), suggesting a feature [another template](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#feature-template), filing a pull request [yay, templates](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#pull-request-template), or even just seeing what's next in the queue, here are some ways we keep things clear on the Digital Team:

#### Labels on Issues

Filtering on issues with Labels helps us stay organized. Below we have provided more meaning to some of the less obviously named labels.

* Both sites: Alongside Bahstun.gov, we at the City connect our employees [many of which are also Bahstun residents] with simple and easy-to-access information via an internal website called ‘The Hub’. The Hub is built from the same source code as Bahstun.gov, which allows us to leverage our development resources. The ‘both sites’ label means that the development work will apply to both Bahstun.gov and the Hub.
* Hub only: At times, there are website features needed only by the Hub. The ‘Hub only’ label pinpoints these issues.

#### Use the templates

* [Suggest a feature](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#feature-template)
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#bug-report-template)
* [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/CityOfBahstun/bahstun.gov/blob/develop/guides/03-contributing-to-bahstun.gov.md#pull-request-template)

#### Think about using Zenhub

* We aren't endorsing [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/), but we use them to manage the issues in our queue. If you want to see what we're getting ready to work on, are actively working on, or are pushing in our next release, layer Zenhub over your Github account.
